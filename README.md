# üèá Horse Race üèá
_Horse race_ is a parallax-scrolling game in which you control a horse; the horse goes through a 4-races grand prix to win the Horse Trophy. üèÜ

### Quickstart
Before compilation, you must link the SFML and SQLite (both static and dynamic) libraries. The output file should be placed in the same directory as the img, music and font folders. Dynamic libraries (.DLL files or .so files) and the database (mydb.db file) should also stay there.

### Dependencies
- SFML 2.5.1
- SQLite 3.35.5

### CMake
Here's a ready CMake file to build the project.
```CMake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
project(horserace)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)
set(SFML_INC_DIR YOUR_PATH_TO_SFML/include)
include_directories(${SFML_INC_DIR})
include_directories(./include)

add_executable(horserace
        main.cpp
        src/Track.cpp
